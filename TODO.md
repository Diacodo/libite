TODO ... in no particular order
===============================

* Improve documentation, possibly use kdoc or gdoc2 to generate docs from API
* Continuously, update OpenBSD functions/macros
* Investigate adding FreeBSD pidfile_open() et al
* Investigate FreeBSD libutil library, could be useful for porting between unices
